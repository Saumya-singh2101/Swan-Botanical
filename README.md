# Swan-Botanical
This is the first website i have ever made

This repository contains the front-end code for the official Swan Botanicals brand website. The project's core mission is to showcase the brand's commitment to botanical purity and gentle care, as highlighted by key selling points such as being "Mother-Tested, Dermatologist-Verified" and using "99% Botanical, 0% Synthetic Chemicals." The website is designed to be a comprehensive digital platform that informs customers about the brand's mission, product offerings, and stringent quality standards, ultimately building trust and confidence in the brand.

The website is built using HTML for its structural foundation and CSS for styling and visual presentation. The design leverages specific fonts, such as 'Playfair Display' and 'Great Vibes', to reflect the brand's luxurious and nurturing identity. The color palette is meticulously crafted with shades of green to convey a natural, botanical aesthetic, in line with the brand guidelines. Additionally, the CSS has been implemented to ensure a responsive design, making the website accessible and visually appealing across various devices. The recent addition of a circular logo on the right side of the page further enhances the overall brand aesthetic
